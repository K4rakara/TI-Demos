# TI-Demos contributing guidelines

1. Demos must not directly attack any individual or group: **Don't be an asshole.**
2. Demos must be SFW. If you want to show off a NSFW demo for whatever reason, put it on your own repo: **No porn lmao.**
3. Use the following naming scheme for the folder containing your demo:

| Name of demo | Name of author | Date the demo was created (US date format.) |
| - | - | - |
| exampleDemoName | exampleAuthorName | 1-1-1970 |

4. Provide a screenshot/gif of your demo in the readme.

If you meet all these guidelines, feel free to make a pull request!
